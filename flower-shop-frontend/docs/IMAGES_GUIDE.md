# Images Guide

- Place all product images into `public/images/`.
- Ensure filenames match what's referenced by your data (e.g., `products` in backend).
- Recommended sizes: 600–800px on the shortest side, JPG or WebP.
- Keep names lowercase, alphanumeric with dashes/underscores (e.g., `rose_red.jpg`).

> When migrating from an existing project, copy your entire images folder into `public/images/`.
